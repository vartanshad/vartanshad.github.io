Welcome to my page. I am currently a Researcher at the Harvard Law School International Postgraduate Research Program. I was previously a [John M. Olin Fellow in Law and Economics at Harvard Law School](http://www.law.harvard.edu/programs/olin_center/fellowships.php).

I hold a J.D. from Harvard Law School, an M.A. in Economics from the University of British Columbia, and a B.A. in Philosophy, Politics, and Economics from the University of Oxford.
