Welcome to my page. I am currently a Researcher at the Harvard Law School International Postgraduate Research Program. I was previously a [John M. Olin Fellow in Law and Economics at Harvard Law School](http://www.law.harvard.edu/programs/olin_center/fellowships.php). I also co-founded and was executive director of the Aleph Policy Initiative, a non-profit economic consultancy that specialized in the gathering and use of quantitative data to carry out social science. My work has often involved working with policy-makers. In 2018 I testified as an [expert witness for the House of Commons Standing Committee on Citizenship and Immigration](https://parlvu.parl.gc.ca/Harmony/en/PowerBrowser/PowerBrowserV2/20181004/-1/30128).

I'm interested in economics, finance, and the intersection of law with these subjects. My research focuses on industrial organization and political economy, particularly as it relates to regulatory bodies. I am also interested in developing behavioral economics and game-theoretic concepts that capture the richness of human behavior as observed, and using those concepts to explain larger scale phenomena in markets and government. You can see my research [here](https://vartanshad.github.io/research/).

I hold a J.D. from Harvard Law School, an M.A. in Economics from the University of British Columbia, and a B.A. in Philosophy, Politics, and Economics from the University of Oxford. In 2021 I will be starting as an associate at Skadden, Arps's DC office.
