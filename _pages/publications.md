### Economics

**Collusive Pricing with Consumer Search**  
I develop a model of optimal collusive pricing when consumers face search costs and firms can only verify each other's prices ex-post. Novel results for the optimal level of firm price dispersion are derived. Variance of firm prices is higher than that of a monopolist when discount levels are high, but is lower when discount levels are low.

**Learning-Constrained Agents**  
I develop an economic model of learning-constrained agents, who choose a posterior subject to a cost that depends on the Kullback-Leibler divergence (a measure of relative entropy of distributions) from the prior. A game-theoretic concept with multiple agents is also defined.

**Partitioned-Cooperation Equilibrium**  
I develop a refinement of Subgame Perfect Equilibrium providing a solution to repeated games where exogenous coalitions of players cooperate, but where coalitions compete against each other.
