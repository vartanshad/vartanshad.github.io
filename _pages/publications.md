## Economics

**Collusive Pricing with Consumer Search**  
*International Journal of Industrial Organization*, Revise and Resubmit.  
I develop a model of optimal collusive pricing when consumers face search costs and firms can only verify each other's prices ex-post. Novel results for the optimal level of firm price dispersion are derived. Variance of firm prices is higher than that of a monopolist when discount levels are high, but is lower when discount levels are low.

**The Welfare Effects and Stability of Semicollusion**  (with Thomas Ross and Leonardo Basso).

**Learning-Constrained Agents** 
I develop an economic model of learning-constrained agents, who choose a posterior subject to a cost that depends on the Kullback-Leibler divergence (a measure of relative entropy of distributions) from the prior. A game-theoretic concept with multiple agents is also defined.

**Partitioned-Cooperation Equilibrium**  
I develop a refinement of Subgame Perfect Equilibrium providing a solution to repeated games where exogenous coalitions of players cooperate, but where coalitions compete against each other.

## Law
**Multiple-Rule Cost-Benefit Analysis** (with Robert Delaney)  
*Charleston Law Review*, Forthcoming.

**Optimal Rulemaking**  
I examine the concept of optimality as it applies to rulemaking activities by agencies. The literature has focused on 'narrow optimality' -- the optimality of particular rules when compared to alternatives and the status quo -- at the expense of 'broad optimality' -- the optimality of agency action taken as a whole. I examine the concept of broad optimality, whether it is suitable for assessing agency behavior, and the ways in which agencies might fail to meet the broad optimality standard. Existing critiques of agency behavior are often implicitly concerns about 'broad optimality' and are discussed.
