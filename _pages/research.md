## Economics

**Collusive Pricing with Consumer Search**  
*International Journal of Industrial Organization*, Revise and Resubmit.  
I develop a model of optimal collusive pricing when consumers face search costs and firms can only verify each other's prices ex-post. Novel results for the optimal level of firm price dispersion are derived. Variance of firm prices is higher than that of a monopolist when discount levels are high, but is lower when discount levels are low.

**The Welfare Effects and Stability of Semicollusion**  (with Thomas Ross and Leonardo Basso).
Economic paper in which we develop a model where firms set both prices and a second variable (such as quality). Firms can fully collude on both variables, or they can choose to collude on just one of the two variables (semicollusion). We  exmine self-enforcing semicollusion and compare stability and welfare to that of full collusion. 

**Learning-Constrained Agents**  
I develop an economic model of learning-constrained agents, who choose a posterior subject to a cost that depends on the Kullback-Leibler divergence (a measure of relative entropy of distributions) from the prior. A game-theoretic concept with multiple agents is also defined.

**Partitioned-Cooperation Equilibrium**  
I develop a refinement of Subgame Perfect Equilibrium providing a solution to repeated games where exogenous coalitions of players cooperate, but where coalitions compete against each other.

## Law
**Multiple-Rule Cost-Benefit Analysis** (with Robert Delaney)  
*Charleston Law Review*, Forthcoming.  
Federal agencies often conduct cost-benefit analysis (CBA) on a rule individually. However, rules can have ‘positive interdependencies,’ whereby one rule can increase the effectiveness of another rule. They can also have ‘negative interdependencies,’ whereby one rule can decrease the effectiveness of another rule. In a world where agencies pass large numbers of rules, interdependencies between rules confound the validity of individual CBA estimates. In such situations, current CBA practices lead to improper rule promulgation and review, a problem that we term ‘interdependency error.’ This paper develops a Multiple-Rule Cost-Benefit Analysis (MCBA) approach and provides principles and tools that an agency can use when implementing, removing, updating, or replacing a rule. MCBA is compared to current trends towards regulatory budgets and retrospective review; Multiple-Rule Cost-Benefit Analysis extends retrospective review and offers a superior means to address the concerns of regulatory budgeting proponents.

**Optimal Rulemaking**  
I examine the concept of optimality as it applies to rulemaking activities by agencies. The literature has focused on 'narrow optimality' -- the optimality of particular rules when compared to alternatives and the status quo -- at the expense of 'broad optimality' -- the optimality of agency action taken as a whole. I examine the concept of broad optimality, whether it is suitable for assessing agency behavior, and the ways in which agencies might fail to meet the broad optimality standard. Existing critiques of agency behavior are often implicitly concerns about 'broad optimality' and are discussed.

## Policy

**Wilting in the Kurdish Sun: The Hopes and Fears of Religious Minorities in Northern Iraq** (with Crispin M.I. Smith)  
*United States Commission on International Religious Freedom* (May 2017)  
Coauthored policy report pursuant to contract with USCIRF to produce report on religious freedom in northern Iraq. Built 10-person research team to analyze statutes, construct region's most exhaustive ethnoreligious mappings from over 800 sources, and statistically analyze satellite data following methodology in Alesina et al. (JPE, 2016). Wrote findings into published policy report (see below). Report used by policymakers including in U.S. Department of State.
