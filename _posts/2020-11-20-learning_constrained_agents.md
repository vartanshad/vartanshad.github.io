In this blog post, I explore the concept of a "learning-constrained agent," and set out directions for a future research agenda.

Learning-Constrained Agents
======

\[D_{KL}(P| | Q) = \sum_{x\in X}P(x)\log \left(\frac{P(x)}{Q(x)}\right)\]


\\[D_{KL}(P| | Q) = \sum_{x\in X}P(x)\log \left(\frac{P(x)}{Q(x)}\right)\\]

$$D_{KL}(P| | Q) = \sum_{x\in X}P(x)\log \left(\frac{P(x)}{Q(x)}\right)$$
